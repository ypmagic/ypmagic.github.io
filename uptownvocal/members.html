      <h2>Kwabena Ayim-Agoabye - Treasurer</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Kwabs</span> is the newest addition to our UV bass section, and he brings the party with him wherever he goes. His slick moves perfectly match his rich bass tone, and whether he is running through bass lines, out on the field playing rugby/football/track or saying hi to every person he passes, Kwabs makes everyone around him smile.</p>

      <h2>Victoria Alejandro</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Victoria Alejandro</span> is a beautiful and talented singer-songwriter hailing from Southern California. With her excited grin and confident personality, Victoria adds the perfect amount of spunk to Uptown Vocal. Not only does Victoria have an incredibly sultry and jazzy tone, she adores theatre and is a wonderful actress. Victoria spends her nights at multiple rehearsals and yet still manages to have enough energy to power a country. When not at one of her many practices, Victoria can be found exploring New York City, eating a burger at the Diana Center, or taking one of her coveted long naps. Victoria has always dreamed of becoming a famous jazz club singer. Don’t be surprised when her dream becomes a reality. Watch out world, this girl is a superstar!</p>

      <h2>Jackie Brown - Music Director</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Jackie Brown</span> brings the spunk to the soprano section. Hailing from Scarsdale, NY, she is one of the sassiest members skilled in deflecting satire with her own witty sarcasm. When she’s not gracing us with her superb sop tones, she’s stage managing at the Shakespearian level in Columbia’s own KCST or stepping into the spotlight in campus musical productions. But while she steals the stage everywhere she goes, she is also sweet and sincere and always ready for a snuggle.</p>

      <h2>Karinya Ghiara - Business Manager</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Karinya Ghiara</span> has an exceptionally strong yet sweet alto tone to match her refreshingly kind and upbeat personality. Originally from San Diego, Karinya arrived in New York City with a smile on her face and excitement in her eyes. Her cheery attitude brings much appreciated humor and energy to Uptown Vocal. In addition to her vivacity and vocal skill, Karinya loves theatre and is a fabulous actress. It may seem like Karinya could not wipe the smile off her face if she tried, but don’t be fooled- when she slips into whatever character she is playing, you might not even recognize her! Karinya was born to perform and is an incredible asset to Uptown Vocal. Most importantly, Karinya really loves a good grilled cheese.</p>

      <h2>Carson Kraft</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Carson Kraft</span> hails from the lovely city of San Fran, and her beautiful high timbre cuts through the noise sharp as a stiletto. She studies computer science, serves as a fashion trendsetter for the rest of us, and is a frequent visitor of JJ’s place, from where she draws her aesthetic inspiration. You better watch out – she isn’t afraid to knock a couple belters down to get to the top of the UV social pyramid.</p>

      <h2>Martin Kyalwazi</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Marty K</span> is his name, and smiling is his game. His charming looks and tender personality will have you itching to hear his voice. Hailing from the Golden state, not only does he bring a chill California vibe, but he also brings a soulful and gentle mystique to the crude basses. When he’s up on stage, be ready to hear him groove like MJ and sing like Ben E. King. When he’s not in rehearsal, you can find him at Dodge Gym draining 3s like Steph Curry and breaking ankles. Don’t be scared to play him though: he’s premed so he’ll fix you up after a game!</p>

      <h2>Maddy Meyer</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Maddy Meyer</span> brings the heat to our sultry soprano section. She hails from the windy city of Chicago and adds some chill vibes to match. Her love for all things dogs is matched only by Victoria, and we are sure to have a few puppies added to the UV family from her in the near future. She generally maintains her pro figure skating poise, but give her a two-pound bag of jelly beans and she’ll devour them faster than you can say Miley Cyrus.</p>

      <h2>Brent Morden</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Brent Morden</span> is the next great American composer. Hailing from beautiful Bayside, Queens, this musical mastermind keeps UV in key with his perfect pitch and his smooth bass voice. Brent's talents expand far beyond a cappella: he also performs in the Columbia Wind Ensemble and writes music for groups of all shapes and sizes. He's the only Uptown Vocalian with a bird, and he'll soon be leading the house band on the Eric Andre Show.</p>

      <h2>Emile Motta de Castro</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Emile Motta de Castro</span> brings his smooth dance moves and even smoother tenor blend to Uptown Vocal this year. A well-versed vocalist hailing from Chicago, LA, Miami, and even Argentina, this kid’s got a story to his travels, his name, and even his Trilogy. Better yet, he can tell you these stories in fluent Spanish! When he isn’t lighting up the quiet hallways of Furnald with his melodious voice, Emile can be found breakdancing outside of Roone -- we kid you not. Uptown Vocal couldn’t be more ecstatic to have Emile as the suavest tenor addition to our UV family.</p>

      <h2>Gus O'Connor</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Gus</span> is our oh-so-lovely tenor with the voice of an angel and the best dancing moves in town. He is in high demand, so between Uptown Vocal and Varsity Show, he has kept busy! He has the most contagious smile on campus, and makes every room brighter when he walks in. He captures the true essence of all things Uptown Vocal, and we are lucky to sing our jazzy tunes with him.</p>

      <h2>Jayne Reel</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Jayne Reel's</span> sultry and deep mezzo tone perfectly matches her personality: unique, interesting, and you always want to hear more. Hailing from the show choir capital of Connecticut, you can usually find her studying something psychology or statistics related or watching Criminal Minds. She is always down for a milk shake or grilled cheese at Toms, and even though the sopranos want to steal her, she will always be a beloved member of the alto section.</p>

      <h2>Jonathan Shapiro</h2>
      <p><span class="member-text-bold">Jon Shapiro</span> is ready to make it big in the big city, trading in the comfortable plaid-and-khakis of suburban Westchester for the suit-and-tie of the Uptown Life. Jon, or “Shappy” as he is affectionately referred to, is a talented multi-instrumentalist. In the down time between rehearsals, he can often be found playing beautiful jazz standards, while we just sit back and tap our collective feet and stroke our chins introspectively. During parties, he’s more apt to grab the nearest guitar and belt out a lively rendition of a Beatles tune to get us all twisting and shouting. Jon is a very witty guy with bundles of musical talent, an expansive knowledge of musical trivia, a keen fashion sense and an excellent sense of humor. He may not the greatest snowman builder, but we won’t hold that against him.</p>
