			<p>Snapchat is a well known app among teenagers. The picture above is the official logo of Snapchat. The white within the logo is supposed to depict a ghost. The ghost represents how messages within Snapchat are very short-lived.</p>

			<h2><span class="border-spacing">Mom: How do I add my friends?</span></h2>
			<p>
			 	Adding friends in Snapchat is unique, as they cannot be found easily. Adding a specific person requires his exact username
			 	so he can be added. Another option is to ask the person for a screenshot of his Snapcode, a personal identifier within Snapchat.
			</p>
			<p>
			 	Once you add a person on Snapchat, that person must also add you back for you to be friends, much like the friend request
			 	functionality on Facebook. After the person adds you back, you can send that person a snap, an exclusive word for a picture or video sent through Snapchat, view his story, snaps that are made available for all friends for twenty four hours, or simply talk to him in a private chat room.

		<h2><span class="border-spacing">Mom: What's so special about Snapchat?</span></h2>
		<section class="twenty-four">
			<p>	
				Snapchat is the rave because snaps expire directly after the recepient sees them. Chatting in Snapchat works the same way. After the recipient sees the chat message, the message is purged from display unless he saves it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To prevent the recipient from "exposing" the sender, if he chooses to send any scandalous photos, there is a built-in notification if the recipient screenshots the snap. The sender gets a push notification stating the recipient took a screenshot. The same functionality applies to the Snapchat story.
			</p>
			<p>
				Normally, it is part of Snapchat etiquette to not screenshot snaps or someone's story. Some common exceptions include the sender being your best friend, if you are part of the picture, or if you have a good enough of an excuse to do so.

		<!-- What are Snapchat Streaks? -->
		<h2><span class="border-spacing">Mom: What are streaks?</span></h2>
		<section class="streaks">
			<p>
				Snapchat streaks are the number of consecutive days that two people exchanged snaps. To continue a streak, both individuals must snap one another at least once every twenty-four hours. Streaks are often a fun way of showing off popularity, and for sincere individuals, a measure of how close two friends are.
